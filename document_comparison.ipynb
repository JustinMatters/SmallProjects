Our approach involves working with stakeholders, including deer management groups, and adheres to professional standards, industry best practice, and regulations.\n",

Effective deer management is essential for delivering these services, which are influenced by various land use and management regimes.\n",

      "FES promotes collaborative deer management through partnerships like the Great Trossachs Forest project. This approach ensures sustainable deer population numbers, habitat condition assessments, and responsible fencing measures. We prioritize staff training and continual professional development, including health and safety, firearms handling, and marksmanship.\n",
