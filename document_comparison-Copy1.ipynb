They support  jobs, are part of Scotland’s biodiversity and provide us with healthy meat and recreational and sporting opportunities. Wild deer have a special hold on the public and are the animal most frequently associated with Scotland. It is therefore no wonder that how deer are managed in Scotland elicits strong feelings. What is clear, and I trust agreed among all those involved in deer management, is that a healthy, diverse and robust environment is critical. Healthy ecosystems and access to the services they provide, form the foundation upon which Scotland’s rural and urban communities can thrive.  This 2014 Review of Scotland’s Wild Deer: A National Approach (WDNA)  builds on the achievements since 2008. Many have worked together to deliver a range of actions to promote wild venison, provide opportunities for people to see deer and protect special natural habitats. However, there is still much to do and the challenge to maximise the benefits from our land continues.  Wild deer do have a negative impact on the natural environment, in certain  places, as well as wider impacts on forestry and agriculture. The Native Woodland Survey of Scotland (2006–2012) showed that inappropriate deer numbers are preventing woodlands from thriving. This impacts on the role these woodlands can play in our climate change responses. Inappropriate wild deer numbers are also preventing the recovery of a number of protected, vulnerable species and sites.\n",
      "1 numbers are also preventing the recovery of a number of protected, vulnerable species and sites. I acknowledge the improvements that have been delivered so far, but deer managers must look to reduce these negative impacts further and enhance the provision of wider public benefits. The Scottish Government will continue to put healthy ecosystems and access  and enjoyment of our countryside at the forefront of land use. Scotland’s landscapes are internationally renowned and attract tourists and economic investment from far and wide. How deer are managed will contribute to the Scottish Government’s vision for a strong relationship between the people of Scotland and the land of Scotland. I believe this contribution should and can be a positive one. I continue to support the voluntary approach to wild deer management but wish there to be no doubt that clear expectations have been placed on deer and land managers to deliver an enhanced range of public interests alongside their private objectives. I acknowledge the private investment which goes into deer management.  Deer Management Groups and deer management planning have come a long way but the pace of change needs to quicken. This WDNA sets out where the challenges and priorities for the next five years lie. It sets out how those involved in deer management can adopt higher standards of deer management planning and delivery.  This WDNA provides those who utilise Scotland’s wild deer resource with the  opportunity to show how deer management can contribute to the Scottish  Land Use Strategy, to any future Land Reform policies and proposals and to  support a wide range of benefits from Scotland’s land. It is the responsibility of all those involved with and who have an interest in deer to deliver the WDNA. Actions on the ground will be co-ordinated through the WDNA Action Plans. I look forward to receiving updates, through these Action Plans, on how the challenges within WDNA are being met. Dr Aileen McLeodMinister for\n",

Scotland’s Wild Deer: A National Approach (WDNA) is a 20 year vision for  wild deer management. Launched in November 2008 it was developed and is being delivered by private and public bodies working together. WDNA is relevant to all species of wild deer in Scotland and all types of land ownership and land management; from the uplands to towns and cities. It is relevant to all organisations and individuals who have an interest in deer and their management.  Wild deer are an asset to Scotland. They play an important role in our rural  economy, provide us with\n",
      "3 deer are an asset to Scotland. They play an important role in our rural  economy, provide us with healthy food and recreational opportunities and are integral to Scotland’s ecosystems. Red and roe deer are commonly regarded as “iconic” animals. When not managed well, however, deer can impact negatively on the natural heritage, forestry, agriculture and public safety.  Wild deer are managed throughout Scotland by a wide range of land  management interests including individuals, businesses, recreational and community bodies and organisations across private, voluntary and public sectors. All these groups have a role to play in delivering the long-term vision described in WDNA. The Code of Practice on Deer Management, introduced in 2012, describes the ‘responsibility’ to ‘manage deer sustainably’ 1. Ongoing delivery of WDNA will rely on increasing  collaboration among land use interests and the Scottish Government.  There has been a recent increase in debate about deer management. There  is a growing desire for deer management to deliver wider public benefits and to ensure the negative impacts on the natural heritage, along with wider economic costs, are minimised. Deer management is under increasing public and political scrutiny. The Review recognises this, and sets out the challenges that need to be addressed to meet this expectation. This is part of a wider change in land use policy in Scotland that acknowledges that ecosystem health is at the heart of a healthy and diverse economy and key to delivering the Government’s long term goals.  This first five-year Review of WDNA prioritises actions for sustainable deer  management in Scotland for 2015–2020. 1.2 Wild Deer in Scotland There are four species of wild deer in Scotland: roe, red, sika and fallow. A fifth species, muntjac, has been reported but has not been confirmed as being resident in Scotland. Roe deer and red deer are native species; they colonised Scotland naturally after the end of the last glaciation ar\n",
      "4 deer are native species; they colonised Scotland naturally after the end of the last glaciation ar ound  10,000 years ago and wild populations have survived in Scotland since then. Sika and fallow deer have both become established following intr oduction.  See Wild Deer Best Practice Guides for further information on their ecology: WDBP Guide – red deer ecology, WDBP Guide – roe deer ecology, WDBP Guide – fallow deer ecology, WDBP Guide – sika deer ecology 2.  The total population of wild deer in Scotland is not known as assessing national populations is an inaccurate science. The most recent population counts give national estimates of 360,000–400,000 red deer, 200,000–350,000 roe deer, 25,000 sika and 8,000 fallow 3. Land managers in Scotland  use local deer counts to inform management decisions at a local level. The focus should remain ‘on the impacts of deer rather than their absolute numbers’ 4.4 5 5 SNH Code of Practice on Deer Management 20121.3 Managing Wild Deer The legal framework for wild deer management derives from Scots law,  under which deer belong to no-one until they are killed or captured. The right to shoot deer cannot normally be separated from the ownership of land. Deer management is carried out by land managers on a range of land holding types, including estates, farms, amenity parks and crofts and through recreational stalking.  Wild deer should be managed to meet a wide range of objectives. These  are made up of individual land manager’s private interests and public interests as captured in policy and legislation. ‘Private and public interests are often interdependent but in some circumstance they can come into conflict. Whilst investment in deer management provides jobs and supports local communities, maintenance of high deer populations to support demand for stalking may lead to negative effects e.g. environmental damage’ 5.  Whilst public and private interests can be mutually supportive, managing conflicting objectives is one of the key\n",
      "5 and private interests can be mutually supportive, managing conflicting objectives is one of the key challenges that land managers and government will need to address. A more open, collaborative approach to deer management is an important way to deliver more integrated and balanced outcomes.

Healthy ecosystems exist at different scales from an individual pond up to a forest or an ocean. In the uplands a ‘deer range’, as an ecosystem, can extend from the bottom of a glen to the top of a mountain ridge. In an urban context, woodland, bordered by houses, is an ecosystem. Both are characterised by interdependent processes.  Deer are a key part of an ecosystem. Healthy ecosystems bring multiple  benefits to land, people, nature and to the deer themselves. Healthy ecosystems provide services like wild food, flood protection, clean water and valued landscapes. Deer contribute to and have an impact on these services. To maximise these benefits land managers should take into account the relationship between deer and the land they live upon. They also take account of the range of benefits people get from deer and the land, both direct (e.g. stalking and venison) and indirect (e.g. tourism and wildlife watching). Those who benefit from the land and who influence it should be involved in the decisions about how it should be managed. Given the wider impacts that deer management can have it is important that land managers engage with other interested parties so there is broader input to management decisions. Deer contribute to ecosystem services by being a source of wild food (the  annual value of venison sales is approximately £2million 6) and provide  inspiration\n",
      "6 food (the  annual value of venison sales is approximately £2million 6) and provide  inspiration for people to get outdoors as a part of wildlife tourism. They also provide stalking opportunities (a survey 7 carried out by the Association of  Deer Management Groups suggested that the annual value to the Scottish economy of deer stalking was estimated as £105 million for 2005). Deer  can also impact negatively on these services by damaging woodlands (in 2013, assessments concluded that 23% of protected features in the red deer range were in unfavourable condition 8) and soils. Deer can also impact  negatively on the role of riparian woodland in stabilising river banks and regulating the temperature of rivers and burns for fish, and reducing the role of peat soils in storing carbon. Some aspects of deer management, such as fences and hill tracks, can adversely affect valued landscapes and peoples’ enjoyment of these places. The WDNA vision seeks to achieve the best combination of benefits for  the economy, environment and people, while acknowledging that healthy ecosystems underpin sustainable economic growth. This balance will vary at a local level and land management priorities can come into conflict. Where resolving tensions between priorities at a local level is not possible and Government involvement is needed, this intervention will prioritise maintaining healthy ecosystems.  This revised WDNA focuses on taking account of how ecosystems work and  the services that ecosystems provide to people so that those that manage land and deer can build on the benefits and minimise the costs acr oss a  range of public and private interests. 8 1.5 What’s New? There have been significant changes to policy and regulation since the  launch of WDNA in 2008. Fundamental changes were introduced to deer management through the Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Act 2011.

      "7 The Code of Practice on Deer Management (Deer Code), developed by SNH in consultation with relevant interests, came into effect in 2012. The Deer Code allocates deer management responsibilities and recognises the public interest in deer management. Regulatory actions have been further clarified and simplified. Changes to the way we view, use and manage deer and the land are  likely to continue over the next five years. Diminished resources, greater recognition of the contribution made by nature to Scotland’s economy and a stronger focus on climate change will undoubtedly bring new challenges. Deer management, through its place in delivering better integrated land use, will play a pivotal role in society’s response to these challenges.

Background Some of Scotland’s 4 deer species are expanding  in both their numbers and their distribution. In  particular roe deer are adapting to new habitats and  environments and are now common place in close  proximity to Scotland’s human population. This is  largely due to:  ♦ Habitat creation ranging from large  afforestation schemes to small community  woodlands  ♦ Government targets to expand woodland  cover (eg. Central Scotland Green Network)  ♦ An ability of roe to adapt into new habitats  within the urban fringe where they  were  once resident, were displaced and are now  subsequently re-colonising. Opportunities  ♦Increased biodiversity – Deer, as one of our  largest mammals, may be seen as a measure of  success for urban, green belt, regeneration. ♦Importance for\n",

Challenges  ♦ Public safety issues – Deer vehicle collisions  (DVCs) 8,000–10,000 annually across Scotland  with 65 of these causing serious human injury.  ♦Public perception of need to manage deer,  legitimate firearms use and public safety.  ♦Recognising different viewpoints.  ♦Deer impacts to woodlands involving both  commercial and community interests.  ♦Damage to property, gardens, golf courses,  cemeteries.  ♦Deer Welfare problems – DVCs, entanglement  in wire fences, choking on plastic bags and  other toxic materials, dog attacks, poaching,  wounding by air rifles, cross bows, snaring &  trapping.

It sets out ten principles for Sustainable Land Use (See Annex 1) that should inform land use choices across Scotland.  The following list identifies other relevant new policy, strategy and  legislation since WDNA was first published. Further details are available in Annex 2. A review of deer management by the Scottish Parliament Rural Affairs,  Climate Change and Environment Committee (RACCE) in 2013/14 drew further attention to deer management and the impacts of deer on the natural heritage. The Minister agreed “…that deer populations are having an impact on Scotland’s natural heritage in certain areas. We need to take steps to minimise these impacts, with SNH collaborating with land managers to facilitate improvement, and deploying formal intervention powers where this is necessary” 9. He recognised the need to improve understanding of  the implications of different approaches to deer management on local and rural jobs and communities. The Minister further recognised that “the pace of change has been too slow, in terms of Deer Management Groups developing and implementing deer management plans. I agree that the end of 2016 would be a suitable juncture to consider progress and look to take action if the current voluntary system has not produced a step change in the delivery of effective deer management” 10. The 2014 WDNA seeks to address these challenges through developing a set of priorities for 2015–2020. These priorities will involve all or ganisations  with a contribution to make or an interest in deer and their management – from tourism\n",
      "10 ganisations  with a contribution to make or an interest in deer and their management – from tourism operators, to country sports providers, local authorities, public agencies, environmental and community groups – working together to maximise both public and private benefits. The Climate Change (Scotland) Act introduced in 2009  committing Scotland to reducing its greenhouse gases by  80% by 2050. Associated with this are: • Low Carbon Scotland 2010–2022; • Woodland Expansion – 10,000 hectares per year 2012–   2022; • Scottish Land Use Strategy (see Annex 1 for the     principles). The Scottish Government Economic Strategy was launched  in 2011 setting out principles to help make Scotland more  successful through sustainable economic growth. 2020 Challenge for Scotland’s Biodiversity was published  in 2013 and sets out a target of restoring 15% of degraded ecosystems.  In addition the Scottish Government has ‘mainstreamed the  needs of Rural Scotland into all its policies’.10 11 We manage wild deer to achieve the best  combination\tof\tbenefits\tfor\tthe\teconomy, \t environment, people and communities for now and for future generations.  By 2030: There will be widespread understanding and achievement  of sustainable deer management.  • Deer will be valued as part of Scotland’s natural     heritage, in balance with their habitats and will     contribute to a high quality, robust and adaptable    environment; • Deer will be a resource for diverse sustainable     economic development with adverse impacts on other    land being minimised; • Deer management will promote social well-being    through enjoyment of the outdoors and healthy     lifestyles.

      "11 will  conflict in some places and at some times. These principles set out a way of working which should guide all those involved in deer management planning and implementation.  Wild deer should be managed in a way that:  1. Integrates deer management with other land-use     objectives by:  • Identifying the range of land-use objectives; • Building on opportunities and addressing challenges to     achieve different land-use objectives; • Recognising that the appropriate balance between     sustainable economics, the environment and social well-    being will vary depending on local circumstances; • Encouraging mutual understanding, trust and      collaboration. 13 2. Uses collaboration to achieve management objectives    by: • Identifying who is needed to achieve management     objectives; • Sharing effort and resources to achieve objectives in the    most effective way. 3. Uses a geographical scale and timescale best suited to    achieving the management objectives by: • Identifying the geographical scale at which a range of     objectives are most likely to be achieved;  • Identifying the appropriate timescales in which to achieve    and integrate different objectives. 4. Engages and communicates with all relevant interests    by: • Identifying stakeholders relevant to local circumstances,    including community interests; • Actively considering the objectives of all stakeholders;  • Providing opportunities for all stakeholders to      inform management planning and be informed about deer    management. 5. Uses sound science and the best available evidence and    knowledge by: • Using feedback and research to inform management; • Sharing and disseminating information among all relevant    interests. 6. Promotes deer welfare by: • Applying best practice in deer management at all times to    ensure the welfare of deer is safeguarded.14 3.2 WDNA Objectives: The Public Interest in     Deer Management  Having deer as part of Scotland’s natural heritage is a public\n",
      "12 Interest in     Deer Management  Having deer as part of Scotland’s natural heritage is a public interest. Deer  also have positive and negative impacts on other public interests. The public interest in deer management is grouped under the following three broad outcomes taken from the WDNA Vision: • A high quality, robust and adaptable environment • Sustainable economic development • Social well-being Contributing to a high quality, robust and adaptable  environment The following public interests seek to ensure that Scotland continues to  have populations of wild deer valued and managed as an integral part of its ecosystems.  Contribute to healthy ecosystems and conserve and    enhance biodiversity in the wider countryside Wild deer will be managed as a part of ecosystems, with their impacts on  and role within water catchments, soil structure and habitats taken into consideration in management planning. Biodiversity objectives will be an integral part of deer management  planning. The appropriate levels of grazing and trampling by deer a) 15 Caption xxxxx xxxxxx  xxxxx xxx xx xxxxxxx (alongside livestock and other herbivores) will be identified as part of the management of Scotland’s ecosystems. Healthy ecosystems provide the foundations for assuring both public and private gain. Opportunities will be taken to enhance the positive effects of deer on biodiversity and, where they contribute to the loss of biodiversity, action will be taken to reduce their negative impacts.  Secure the favourable condition status of Scotland’s sites   designated for nature The management of wild deer along with other grazers has a key r ole to  play in meeting Government conservation targets. The management of wild  deer can contribute to securing the favourable condition of Scotland’ s sites  designated for nature conservation. Action will be taken to establish and maintain appropriate levels of grazing. Help tackle and adapt to the effects of Climate Change The contribution of\n",
      "13 levels of grazing. Help tackle and adapt to the effects of Climate Change The contribution of carbon-rich soils and vegetation cover, including woodland, to the storage and sequestration of carbon is significant. Herbivores can affect the ability of ecosystems to adapt to climate change by influencing their diversity and connectivity. For example heavy browsing causes loss and fragmentation of woodlands through lack of regeneration of trees and shrubs. Grazing, trampling and browsing effects by wild deer (alongside livestock  and other herbivores) will be managed to maintain an appropriate vegetation cover, both in relation to peat and woodlands. Our understanding of the robustness, or otherwise, of habitats, including  soils and water courses will be improved in the face of changing land use, grazing and climate change.b) c)16 Minimise further spread of non-native deer species in    Scotland Action will be taken to prevent the release and subsequent establishment  of non-native deer species, in particular muntjac, in Scotland. This will align with the Code of Practice on Non-Native Species. Sika are already established across many parts of mainland Scotland and are likely to continue to spread. Whilst some land managers view sika as an economic opportunity, others see them as a threat due to the significant damage they can cause to forestry and woodland. Hybridisation with red deer is known to occur in some areas. Where there is local agreement, their spread and the damage they cause will be minimised through active management.  Safeguard the welfare of all species of wild deer  Deer welfare will be considered in all management interventions. Further work will be carried out to identify how best to assess the welfar e status of  both individual and groups of deer. Opportunities will be taken to engage the public in developing understanding of wild deer management and deer welfare.

      "14 and deer welfare.  Conserve and enhance the cultural and historic environment   and the distinct identity, diverse character and special    qualities of Scotland’s landscapes  Deer management will contribute positively to the appearance and  condition of the landscape. Deer management will also contribute to the cultural and historic environment (and people’s enjoyment of it) through managing grazing and trampling impacts. d) e) f) 17 Contributing to sustainable economic development The following objectives seek to ensure that deer management contributes  to successful rural businesses and the socio-economic development of communities. Increase the economic opportunities associated with wild   deer There is a range of opportunities to add value to deer-related products  and activities, and to broaden the economic benefits associated with the deer resource. These include further developing the markets for stalking, photography and wildlife watching and the further development and appropriate branding of venison products. More broadly the value of wild deer to Scotland’s tourism industry will be better articulated and used. Minimise economic costs attributable to wild deer Although a potential asset in their own right, wild deer can cause economic loss to other land use activities, particularly agriculture and forestry. Wild deer will be managed as part of an integrated approach to land use in order to minimise the negative impacts on other economic activities. Provide the skills and knowledge required to manage deer   as an integral part of Scotland’s natural resources Education and training will be further developed and a culture of continuing  personal and professional development will be promoted for all those involved in deer management.  Contribute to the economic development of communities Deer management provides jobs in remote rural areas and those involved make a contribution to the skills, knowledge and capacity of communities.

The employment and tourism opportunities associated with deer will be further developed. a) b) c) d) 18 Contributing to social well-being The following objectives for deer management will contribute to the well- being of the people of Scotland.  Contribute to a safe and healthy environment for people Road safety risks associated with deer populations and increasing traffic volumes in both rural and urban environments require co-ordinated action between local communities, transport managers and deer management interests. Deer management needs to be considered in smaller scale projects as well as large scale infrastructure developments such as the project to dual the A9.  A range of health and safety risks are associated with deer management and  will be addressed through training and raising awareness. Human disease risks (e.g. TB and Lyme disease) will require monitoring and co-ordinated approaches to management and public awareness. Increase participation in management and enjoyment of    wild deer Opportunities will be developed to broaden participation in and enjoyment  of wild deer, through encouraging new entrants into deer management and stalking, and enabling people to find out more about wild deer, enjoy seeing them and ultimately understand more about deer and their management. Engagement in deer management planning by local communities will be encouraged. Responsible outdoor access will be encouraged through provision of accurate and up-to-date information on stalking activity and provision of information such as where wild deer are likely to be seen. Deer will continue to contribute to the promotion of Scotland’s history and cultural arts.  Manage the impacts of wild deer in and around     communities Wild deer are present in and around many rural communities and urban  areas.

Promote venison as a healthy food The benefits of venison as part of ‘healthy eating’ strategies will be promoted, supported by work on its supply and economic value.a) b) c) d)19 Contributing to all objectives The objectives below interact with the environment, social and economic  objectives: Establish a shared, trusted and high quality knowledge  base associated with wild deer to support local action There are many sources of data and research associated with wild  deer. These will continue to be developed and applied to ensure deer management decisions are underpinned by sound science and good knowledge. Efforts will be taken to co-ordinate and disseminate this knowledge as widely as possible. There will be a focus on developing shared knowledge to encourage local action.  Develop effective frameworks for sustainable deer    management Groups (e.g. Deer Management Groups), networks (e.g. Lowland Deer  Network Scotland) and other deer partnerships and fora play a cor e role in  enabling and supporting deer management through collaboration. These different approaches to working together will continue to be developed, strengthened and increased.  Raise awareness and understanding of wild deer and their  management Raising awareness of the need for deer management in a variety of forms  should lead to more meaningful and informed public debate which in turn should have a positive effect on deer management. Opportunities to raise awareness will be developed.a) b) c) 20 21 11 See www.snh.gov.uk/land-and-sea/managing-wildlife/managing-deer/wdna 12 See www.snh.gov.uk/land-and-sea/managing-wildlife/managing-deer/wdna4 : Delivering    the Vision 4.1 What’s been delivered so far?

      "17 actions have been delivered by over 20 organisations over  the past 5 years. These actions include initiating a national Eat Scottish Venison Day, looking after Scotland’s protected natural heritage sites, publishing the Code of Practice on Deer Management, developing the capacity of Deer Management Groups and establishing the Lowland Deer Network Scotland. However, some aspects of the WDNA vision have been less well represented. Gaps have been recorded against delivery of some of the Key Actions including protection of woodland, bogs and carbon-rich soils in order to enhance carbon storage and agreeing a common understanding of welfare. Further analysis of these gaps and achievements is set out in ‘The WDNA progress and gaps in delivery 2008–2013’ 11. 4.2 Who delivers WDNA? Wild deer are managed throughout Scotland by a wide range of organisations, businesses and individuals across the private, voluntary, and public sectors. All these bodies have a role to play in achieving the WDNA 20 year vision.  Delivery of WDNA from 2015 onwards will rely on further collaboration and  a shared responsibility amongst and between land management interests and the Scottish Government. 4.3 How is WDNA delivered?  WDNA is delivered through the WDNA Action Plans12. The WDNA  Action Plans are co-ordinated by the WDNA Steering Group (see 4.4) with input and advice from stakeholders across the deer sector. Each Plan spans 3 years with detailed actions for the first year and outline actions for the following 2 years. These plans are available on the SNH and other contributor websites. The 2014 Review has reinforced the importance of the WDNA Action Plans.  They provide a demonstration of co-ordinated effort across the deer sector. The role of the WDNA Steering Group has also been expanded to leading and co-ordinating these Action Plans. Since 2012 deer management has also been guided by the Code of Practice  on Deer Management. This is based on the WDNA objectives and sets out what\n",

Progress in achieving the WDNA Vision is measured in two  ways: • Through a set of WDNA trend indicators on the      environment, economy and society as they relate to deer; • Annual progress reports on actions co-ordinated through    the WDNA Action Plans. These actions and indicators provide an insight into the contribution to  the public interest made by those managing deer. They also provide an indication of the impacts of these actions on the wider envir onment,  economy and society.  The set of indicators have been developed collaboratively by all partners.  For some of the indicators, in particular the economic ones, data has pr oved  difficult to collate. Developing these has been included as a priority for the next 5 years. The indicators are listed under the relevant sections in the Priorities in 4.6. Both the progress reports and trends suggested by the indicators have fed  into this first review of WDNA by helping to identify priorities. The WDNA Steering Group will have an important role in evaluating the reasons for any actions which haven’t progressed in future Action Plans. While in some cases changes to the state of the environment, economy or society are actively sought, there may also be unforeseen effects, and changes resulting from external influences which may require adjustments to deer management policy as a result. Implementation of WDNA will be responsive to these potential changes and any changes will be reported in the annual progress report. This joint approach to evaluation and interpretation will help ensure it is objective and thorough. The most recent WDNA indicator report is available on the WDNA web page 13. 4.5 WDNA, 2014 Review The 2014\n",
      "19 recent WDNA indicator report is available on the WDNA web page 13. 4.5 WDNA, 2014 Review The 2014 Review was co-ordinated by the WDNA Steering Group, comprised of representatives from Forestry Commission Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage, the National Parks and Scottish Government. Input from stakeholders was provided through the Deer Management Round Table, representing a wide group of organisations with an interest in deer management and smaller group discussions. These groups met a number of times and provided input into the five-year priorities and the structure of the revised version.  4.6 Priorities for 2015 – 2020 This 2014 Review of WDNA recognises that healthy ecosystems deliver social, economic and environmental benefits. For example, good quality soils support the growth of plants which in turn provide food and shelter for deer and other animals which then help sustain local and national businesses. Government advice, support and intervention will be directed at achieving the best combination of benefits for the economy, environment and people. In circumstances where it is difficult to achieve this balance Government will prioritise healthy ecosystems.23 The high level priorities for 2015–2020 are set out below: Collaboration and Effective Deer Management Planning  and Implementation • Build\ton\twork\tto\tdevelop\tconflict\tmanagement\ttools; • Ensure robust deer management planning; • Promote and implement the Code of Practice on Deer     Management; • Raise awareness of the need for effective deer management; • Establish a shared, trusted and high quality knowledge     base associated with wild deer.

Training and Wild Deer Welfare  • Ensure a strong skill base in deer management; • Understand, promote and deliver wild deer welfare.24 The following section sets out what needs to be done during the period  2015–2020. The WDNA Action Plans will set out the detail, including who will be responsible for their delivery. They should be a focus for collective effort and resources in making progress towards the long-term vision for wild deer. They build on the significant work already carried out by all those involved in deer management. Collaboration and effective deer management  planning and implementation14  Challenges:  • Build on work to develop conflict management tools: Finding   ways to reconcile differences in land management objectives and  motivations continues to be challenging; • Ensure robust deer management planning and implementation:   One of the challenges is to achieve and demonstrate a ‘step    change in the delivery of effective deer management’ by the end  of 2016; • Promote and implement the Deer Code: The Deer Code came  into existence at the beginning of 2012. The challenge is to    ensure that everyone who should know about the Deer Code    does and that it is followed by all relevant parties; • Raise awareness of the need for effective deer\n"

These tools will be targeted to deliver Government priorities. These currently include: Communication and engagement: Effective communication and  engagement with relevant interests is fundamental to the successful delivery of WDNA. All those involved have a role to play in ensuring continued improvements in knowledge and understanding.  Advice, guidance and training: There is a range of existing advice,  guidance and training to help guide the detailed delivery of WDNA, including the Code of Practice on Deer Management and the Wild Deer Best Practice Guides.  Financial support: Deer management is supported from a range of public  and private sources including the Scottish Rural Development Programme. Regulation: Government has powers of regulation to act as a backstop in  safeguarding the public interest in deer management. Many of these are set out in the Deer (Scotland) Act 1996 (as amended). Publicly owned land: The Scottish Government owns large tracts of land  in Scotland including the national forest estate, managed by Forestry Commission Scotland, as well as significant holdings managed by Scottish Natural Heritage. These should serve as exemplars of sustainable management, including appropriate deer management and research. 36 37 6 : Monitoring,       Reporting and      Reviewing 6.1 Monitoring Diagram: Delivering, Monitoring and Review Process   There are two strands to monitoring the strategy: a) Monitoring the delivery: the extent to which the objectives of the  strategy are achieved.

      "30 annually; b) Monitoring the impacts: the effects that implementing WDNA has on  the environment, the economy and society. A collection of indicators will  build a picture of trends and progress and will be reported bi-annually. 6.2 Indicators A set of indicators, reflecting the trends in the state of the environment, economy and society as they relate to wild deer, have been developed and are available on the SNH website. These indicators will continue to be refined so that they contribute to the  wider picture of ecosystem health, and increase our understanding of deer numbers and their relationship with habitat condition at a local and regional level. This work, alongside wider monitoring of ecosystem service pr ovision  and economic benefits, will provide a good overall assessment of the contribution that deer make to the well-being of Scotland. 38 6.3 Review WDNA will be reviewed on a rolling five year timetable. It is anticipated  that the vision and objectives should provide a relatively stable long-term context. In contrast, the Priorities are likely to be reviewed more fully at each five year review. In some cases, the issue may have been addressed and no longer be a priority, or other priorities may have emerged during the review.  Where appropriate, if there are likely to be any significant changes made  to WDNA during the five years review, these changes will undergo further Socio-Economic Assessment, Strategic Environmental Assessment [as required under the Environmental Assessment (Scotland) Act 2005] and Equality and Diversification Assessment. 6.4 Annual Reporting The WDNA Steering Group will lead the production of an annual progress report.

Biodiversity: the variety of all living organisms.Browsing: feeding on the woody parts of plants.Carbon Sequestration: provision of absorption and long-term storage of  carbon e.g. in trees, vegetation and soils. Deer Management: refers to a range of actions including protecting  deer; using them as a resource for sport or meat; culling them to manage their numbers and their effect on habitats or to limit their spread; and safeguarding their health and welfare. It does not always mean lethal intervention or culling and may include the use of fencing to exclude them from specific areas, promoting deer or educating others about them.  Designated Nature Conservation Sites: sites which have been designated  by Government to protect their ‘special features’. These special features represent the most important parts of natural heritage. Ecology: inter-relationships between animals, plants, land, water, and air in  an area. Ecosystem: the non-living and living aspects of an environment functioning  together. An ecosystem is made up of plants and animals, water, rocks and soils, and the natural processes that connect them together. An ecosystem can be anything from a pond or a forest to a river catchment, an island, an ocean or even the globe, where what happens in one part can affect other parts. Ecosystem Approach: recognises that our health and prosperity is  intimately connected to the health of nature. It means working for a healthy environment for the benefit of both\n",
      "32 to the health of nature. It means working for a healthy environment for the benefit of both Scotland’s people and Scotland’s nature. In the mostly widely-used definition, from the Convention on Biological Diversity, an ecosystem approach is: ‘a strategy for the integrated management of land, water and living resources that promotes conservation and sustainable use in an equitable way, and which recognises that people with their cultural and varied social needs are an integral part of ecosystems.’ Ecosystem Health: an ecosystem is healthy when all the components are  functioning together in a productive and sustainable manner.  Ecosystem Services: functions and products from nature that can be turned  into goods with varying degrees of human input e.g. naturally managed flood plains, drinking water, and wild food. Favourable Condition: objectives are set for each ‘special feature’. These  objectives describe the state these features are in. e.g. population size (for species) or area covered by a particular plant species (for habitats) which need to be met for the feature to be defined as in ‘favourable condition’.41 Habitat Networks: habitats which are linked together to create a wider,  more sustainable and interconnected pattern of habitats. They take into account the size, shape, isolation and quality of habitats as well as the permeability of species movement across the land between habitat patches. Most habitat-types can be considered, including grassland, heathland, wetlands and woodland.

Red deer refugia were consolidated through  The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (Keeping and Release and Notification Requirements) (Scotland) Order 2012. This order makes it an offence to release any species of the genus Cervus (which includes Sika deer) onto specified Scottish islands.  Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs): a national suite of nature  conservation sites protected as examples of the UK’s flora, fauna, geological or physiographical features.

They also reflect Government policies on the priorities which should inform land use choices across Scotland. We expect that they will be used by public bodies when making plans and taking significant decisions affecting the use of land. We also strongly encourage individuals, businesses and organisations that have significant land management responsibilities to have regard to them. Opportunities\tfor\tland\tuse\tto\tdeliver\tmultiple\tbenefits\tshould\t be encouraged. Regulation should continue to protect essential public  interests whilst placing as light a burden on businesses as is consistent with achieving its purpose. Incentives should be efficient\tand\tcost-effective. Where land is highly suitable for a primary use (for example  food\tproduction,\tflood\tmanagement,\twater\tcatchment\t management and carbon storage) this value should be  recognised in decision-making. Land use decisions should be informed by an understanding  of the functioning of the ecosystems which they affect in order  to\tmaintain\tthe\tbenefits\tof\tthe\tecosystem\tservices\twhich\tthey\tprovide. Landscape change should be managed positively and  sympathetically, considering the implications of change at a  scale appropriate to the landscape in question, given that all Scotland's landscapes are important to our sense of identity  and to our individual and social wellbeing. Land-use decisions should be informed by an understanding  of the opportunities and threats brought about by the  changing climate. Greenhouse gas emissions associated  with land use should be reduced and land should continue to contribute to delivering climate change adaptation and  mitigation objectives.

Opportunities to broaden our understanding of the links  between land use and daily living should be encouraged.i)  j) 44 Annex 2 Strategic and Policy Context: Ecosystem Services  Ecosystem Services focus on the benefits that the natural environment  supplies or supports. There are four types of ecosystem services: supporting services (e.g. soil formation, pollination), provisioning services (e.g. food, water, and timber), regulating services (e.g. absorbing carbon from the atmosphere) and cultural services (e.g. recreation and tourism).  Ecosystem Approach (from the SNH policy statement) An Ecosystem Approach provides a way of valuing nature’s services so that nature can continue to sustain Scotland's health and prosperity now and into the future. Adopting an Ecosystem Approach recognises there are often uncertainties in aspects of land and wildlife management and that this demands an adaptive approach.  An ecosystem approach recognises that our health and prosperity is  intimately connected to the health of nature. It means working for a healthy environment for the benefit of both Scotland’s people and Scotland’s nature. It means putting the benefits that ecosystems give at the centre of our approach to nature. It helps us to recognise that our actions today can affect future\n"

The 2020 Challenge for Scotland’s Biodiversity aims to: • Protect and restore biodiversity on land and in our seas,    and to support healthier ecosystems;  • Connect people with the natural world, for their health and    well-being and to involve them more in decisions about     their environment;  • Maximise\tthe\tbenefits\tfor\tScotland\tof\ta\tdiverse\tnatural\t\t\t  environment and the services it provides, contributing to    sustainable economic growth. 45 Scottish Forest Strategy (including the Woodland  Expansion Target) The Scottish Forest Strategy (SFS) is a framework for taking forestry forward  into the future. It is built around a number of key themes and objectives. The SFS is delivered through a series of rolling implementation plans. The main one of these is the Woodland Expansion Target – which aims to increase the woodland cover of Scotland from 17% to 25% by 2025. This target is also embedded in the Climate Change Act implementation activities.  Scottish Government Economic Strategy 2011 The Purpose of the Scottish Government is ‘to make Scotland a more successful country, with opportunities for all to flourish, through increasing sustainable economic growth’ 23. There are 6 strategic priorities: • Supportive Business Environment; • Transition to a Low Carbon Economy;  • Learning, Skills and Well-being;  • Infrastructure Development and Place;  • Effective Government;  • Equity.

It comprises forests, woodlands and open ground. Widely distributed around Scotland, the NFE has developed over the last 95 years in response to the forestry objectives of successive governments. Around two-thirds is woodland and one-third is open ground, including agricultural land, mountains, peat bogs, water bodies and coast.

We manage the NFE    as a multi-benefit resource to deliver a range of environmental, social and economic benefits in    a range of situations. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DEER   ON THE NATIONAL FOREST ESTATE Where possible we set management strategies  at a landscape scale to determine how best to integrate management objectives and maximise benefit delivery. An example of this would be The Great Trossachs Forest where we manage the Loch Katrine and Loch Achray catchments, habitats and associated deer populations in conjunction with the RSPB and Woodland  Trust Scotland.  We value and manage deer as an iconic and natural resource which contributes to our biodiversity, climate change, social, cultural  and silvicultural objectives. Our deer management objectives and practices will  evolve, modify and adapt as necessary to  reflect changing circumstances such as a  future increase in the range of public  benefits delivered on the NFE.  8 Environmental Social Economic Protecting and enhancing   the environment Native deer are an important component   of Scotland’s biodiversity - they have a major shaping effect on habitats, and their actions fundamentally determine the suitability of ecosystems for other species. We are also responsible for some 12,000 historic  environment features. The best examples of habitats and ancient monuments are subject  to a high level of statutory designations. For example Bessie’s Hill is an Iron Age hill fort in Dumfries & Borders Forest District. The fort has pronounced earthwork ditches and ramparts and is covered in rank grass, but with little by way of natural regeneration of trees and scrub and this is due largely to deer having a positive impact through regular browsing of the site.

      "to deer having a positive impact through regular browsing of the site. This browsing helps achieve the Monument Management Plan which requires keeping the site free of tree/shrubs growth. We aspire to increase the environmental value  of our planted forests through restructuring and diversification – helping natural processes to turn plantations into fully functioning forests. We want to achieve favourable environmental  condition across the NFE, most importantly on designated sites but also more widely across non-designated areas as this is consistent with Scottish Ministers’ land management objectives as laid out in Scotland’s ‘Land Use Strategy’. Achieving favourable conditions and ecosystem health helps meet the aims of the ‘Scottish Biodiversity Strategy’ and ‘Scotland’s Native Woodlands’ and is usually aided by a degree of deer activity which can help maintain vegetation species and structural diversity and influence succession processes. However, high deer impacts can be detrimental, most obviously to woodland regeneration but also to highly palatable ground layer species; to habitat structural diversity; to dependent insect, bird and animal species; and to fragile ecosystems like peat bogs. As indicated in the FCS Biodiversity Programme  ‘Woods for Nature’, we will focus our deer management effort to be as effective as possible in reducing negative biodiversity impacts from deer. Our efforts will be directed at protecting designated sites, priority habitats and encouraging overall woodland diversity and broad ecosystem health across the NFE. Ascertaining the optimum deer impacts to  achieve favourable environmental condition,  and the appropriate deer densities to support this, is complex and we are still developing our skills in this area. By using a combination of habitat impact surveys, dung counting and population data we aim to establish management strategies appropriate to the unique circumstances of each locality.

Over the last 10 years we have been involved with over 100 community partnerships. Through our land management planning consultation, all local communities have the opportunity to comment on local deer management and other aspects of our land management.With the expansion of our ‘Woods In and Around Towns’ (WIAT) programme, we are increasingly managing deer in urban and    peri-urban areas in order to facilitate and protect the creation and maintenance of green space and woodland environments. We have been at the forefront of developing working methods for the management of urban deer, working with local authorities, the police and other urban stakeholders and taking into account safety of the public, welfare of deer and the impact of deer on road safety and residential properties. Concern has been growing over the impact  of deer in road traffic accidents. As we are increasing the presence of the NFE in Scotland’s urban area, this is growing as a priority for us. We are proactive in working with partners to find the best strategies to manage this problem.

We will work to better understand the local  socio-economic impacts of deer and deer management activities on the NFE and on neighbouring properties.   An important aspect of productivity on  the NFE is the growing and production of timber including biomass and firewood – the NFE currently supplies over three million tonnes of timber annually to Scotland’s economically important timber industries, accounting for 40 per cent of  all timber produced in Scotland.    Red deer, Sika and Fallow at high densities, can  impact on the mature timber resource by bark stripping, which damages trees and allows access for tree diseases.  The most significant impact of deer however   is on the establishment of young trees. Some  100 million young trees, representing many millions of pounds worth of investment will  be in the vulnerable establishment phase  on the NFE at any one time. Our woodland  creation programme is at least   500-1,000 ha/annum, and our restocking programme is rising    to around 6,000 ha/annumwith naturally regenerating trees developing within many of our native woodland and continuous cover areas. As we increase tree planting programmes and  seek to diversify the range of timber producing tree species on the NFE, the distribution and number of palatable trees vulnerable to deer impacts will increase. Managing deer impacts is therefore becoming an ever increasing challenge.    This is further  accentuated as we: •   move increasingly to continuous cover  forestry systems where appropriate and increased reliance on the natural regeneration of a wider range of tree species.  •  adapt silvicultural practice (ie increased clearfell followed by restocking and regeneration), to manage the developing scale and impacts of tree disease, such as Dothistroma and Phytophthora.\n",

Between 2011 and 2013, annually  around 11%-20%    of the leading shoots of young trees  suffered damage. We need to reduce this to  below 10%   and maintain the lower level, in order to achieve successful establishment. We will achieve this protection and manage tree disease impacts by applying a combination of locally focused deer cull and by judicious use of perimeter deer fencing where appropriate and, occasionally, internal deer fencing.

Deer Management Current Practice and Future DirectionsLandscape-scale deer management - a partnership approach The Great Trossachs Forest (TGTF) project is   restoring, protecting and enhancing native habitats. Ecosystems with a high biodiversity value are being created and the area is becoming a showcase for wildlife, tourism, research and partnership working.  The project area spans 16,500 hectares (ha),  across three ownerships and includes both designated and non-designated land.  The partner organisations are Forestry Commission Scotland (Loch Katrine 10,610 ha), Woodland Trust Scotland (Glen Finglas 4,870 ha), and Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (Inversnaid Nature Reserve 810 ha).  A key element of project delivery is the  sustainable management of deer, applying best practice, at the local and landscape level through implementation of an effective Deer Management Plan (DMP). The Balquhidder Deer Management Group DMP provides the overall direction for the management of wild deer in this part of Scotland.

Industry best practice We support the deer industry in implementing and developing best practice, standards and assessment of competence.     Managing all four species of deer across Scotland, over many years, across the Highlands, the Lowlands and in the urban environment, we have accumulated a great deal of knowledge and experience which we offer in support of ongoing national developments and initiatives.  Within operational limitations, we offer the  use of FES zeroing areas and deer larders to recognised DMQ Assessment Centres for  training and assessment purposes in the crofting areas where facilities and opportunities are otherwise limited. FES actively participates in the Wild Deer  Best Practice Steering Group, and currently contributes £25,000 /annum   to support its work. We will continue to help develop, promote and implement guidance from the Group, and FES staff will also support related training or best practice events. In liaison with industry groups, we have taken  a lead role to create resources for professional development such as DVDs on stalking deer in woodlands, humane despatch and urban deer management.

Our Wildlife Rangers use the Guardian 24 lone working system which requires logging-in and logging-out, before and after deer management activities. We are currently assessing future needs including the use of technology such as personal locator beacons. We believe that, as outlined in the Scottish  Outdoor Access Code, access and safety should work together, therefore in most circumstances we safely carry out deer management activities whilst maintaining open access to the NFE. However, safety will always be the over-riding principle in all our management activities, and we take full account of patterns of woodland use by the public and operational activities when we are determining our deer management plans for an area.A very important aspect of safety is the stalkers continual observation and risk assessment of the stalking environment and circumstances during the stalk, and the need to be absolutely certain of a safe backdrop before taking the shot. We have produced a deer management  protocol to ensure the safe management  and communication of our deer stalking  activities in and around developments  such as windfarms and hydro schemes.

We are currently reviewing our land management  planning and strategic spatial planning systems to take forward the integrated management of woodland and open space using an ecosystem-based approach. This will achieve more joined-up delivery of a full range of ecosystem services, including deer management aspects, and to better take account of uncertainties and pressures like climate change and invasive exotics.We recognise that woodland creation and development happens over a long time-scale, and that ongoing and consistent deer management is important to avoid failure due to deer impacts.   We plan and manage land on the NFE taking into account the needs of deer management and deer welfare. Our design plans for woodland establishment across the NFE are developed to include appropriate areas of open ground for landscaping, conservation and amenity purposes but also to facilitate safe and effective deer management. Our deer management teams input to planning at the strategic and local level by providing information on deer species and impacts, ensuring the provision of infrastructure such as deer glades, ATV access tracks and fences where appropriate and commenting on tree species choice.

Healthy ecosystems exist at different scales from an individual pond up to a forest or an ocean. In the uplands a ‘deer range’, as an ecosystem, can extend from the bottom of a glen to the top of a mountain ridge. In an urban context, woodland, bordered by houses, is an ecosystem. Both are characterised by interdependent processes.  Deer are a key part of an ecosystem. Healthy ecosystems bring multiple  benefits to land, people, nature and to the deer themselves.

Healthy ecosystems exist at different scales from an individual pond up to a forest or an ocean. In the uplands a ‘deer range’, as an ecosystem, can extend from the bottom of a glen to the top of a mountain ridge. In an urban context, woodland, bordered by houses, is an ecosystem. Both are characterised by interdependent processes.  Deer are a key part of an ecosystem. Healthy ecosystems bring multiple  benefits to land, people, nature and to the deer themselves.

A deer browsed Rowan32 Deciding the   management approach Once deer management objectives have been  set in support of our wider delivery intentions for the land area, the main decision on management approach is the balance between culling and fencing. When making that decision we broadly consider the costs and benefits of each, both financial and in relation to wider benefits and potential issues. The UK Woodland Assurance Scheme requires  that “appropriate wildlife management and control shall be used in preference to fencing”, and generally, management of deer populations by culling offers the most holistic basis for delivering our range of objectives across  the NFE so this will tend to be our  favoured approach where it is viable. Fencing Fences are an important deer management tool but are rarely the complete or ideal solution. Fencing is costly to plan, erect, inspect, repair and dismantle. Fences have a limited life, and can be difficult to keep deer-proof. They are not effective during periods of deep snow, after storms when windblown trees flatten fences,  in areas where vandalism is a problem, or when gates are left open. Furthermore, fences can affect the ranging behaviour of deer, impact on other wildlife like woodland grouse, and can be an impediment to recreation access.

      "to recreation access. They can be visually intrusive, impact on landscapes, and protect only the parts of the forest enclosed leaving the remainder vulnerable to adverse impacts from deer. Fencing within semi-natural woodland to achieve natural regeneration can lead to a dense stand structure that casts heavy shade and threatens rare plants. In many areas fencing forms a part of our  approach to deer management. Where feasible, march fences are an important tool if we have different deer management objectives from  our neighbours. We try to minimise the use  of internal fences, but these can be essential in localised high risk situations, for example where we are establishing concentrations of particularly palatable tree species or productive broadleaved crops that can only tolerate very low deer numbers and need constant protection.  We do make use of electric fencing in some locations but this is limited and can be as  simple as a single strand wire positioned  parallel to a main deer fence.  The delivery of climate change resilience and  managing the scale and impacts of tree disease means that we will be planting an increasingly wide range of palatable broadleaves and alternative conifers, distributed across a wider area of the NFE. In order to reduce browsing damage to leading shoots, we will rely more on an increased culling effort where necessary, effective perimeter deer fencing (in appropriate locations), and less on internal deer fencing  to achieve successful tree establishment.FES sustains major fencing commitments, currently extending to around  2,250 km of deer fences    across the NFE. Each year we spend   in the region of  £0.5-£1 million    on deer fencing. Given limited resources, and  potential negative impacts, fencing activities  have to be carefully targeted for maximum  effect.

We therefore need to monitor this and ensure protection of the NFE’s biological resources throughout the year.   Out of season and night shooting are essential in helping us manage damage impacts. All of our out of season and night shooting activity is discussed with the statutory deer authority, SNH.  All applications are based on an objective justification and require authorisation by SNH.

      "the winter months particularly as Red deer come down to lower elevations.  We work proactively to reduce the risk of road  traffic accidents involving deer on and adjacent to the NFE. We co-operate with local police, Transport Scotland and local communities where there is a heightened potential for deer from the NFE to cause accidents on adjacent public roads. We take this into account when formulating deer management plans for the urban and peri-urban parts of the NFE, and indeed wherever there are busy roads nearby. Despatch of wounded deer We are committed to the humane despatch of injured or dying deer that may result from deer vehicle collisions or ineffective shot placement. Where appropriate we use trained deer dogs  to follow-up wounded deer.  From 2013/14  our staff will receive enhanced training in the methods and options for humane despatch  using rifle, knife or shotgun. In tackling an injured deer our priority is to ensure the safety    of the operator and the public;  and to minimise the suffering of the  injured or dying deer.     Managing significant incursions of deer During particularly severe winters large   numbers of deer may move onto the NFE.  This may even happen in fenced areas as  snow builds up along the fence-line. The result can be rapid with severe impacts to young trees and important habitats, jeopardising the achievement of objectives, setting management progress back sometimes many years, and resulting in high remedial costs. It can also impact adversely on resident deer populations given that there is limited food and shelter within any given locality. In these conditions deer may be severely weakened and deer welfare becomes a major consideration. In consultation with the deer management  sector we have developed an agreed protocol for managing emergency situations resulting from major deer incursions. This involves a rapid assessment of the situation and immediate communication with neighbours to discuss each specific incursion,\n",

They can interbreed with Red deer and can cause particularly severe damage to trees.  We are committed to the effort to reduce the expansion of Sika deer and to help reduce impacts on the genetic integrity of the Scottish Red deer population. Where they are present, Sika deer  are a particular focus of our culling effort. During the past 15 years FES has cooperated with Edinburgh University in collecting DNA samples for their Red/ Sika hybridisation research project. In 2012/13 FES activity represented 54 per cent   of Scotland’s Sika cull.  Feral boar Feral boar impacts on the NFE tend to be localised with turning over of the soil, turf, ground vegetation, forest roadsides, rides and in-bye land with some limited damage to restock sites or trees for example through damaging or lifting the lower sections of fences thus allowing access by other herbivores.Sightings of feral boar (including breeding populations), and reports of damage are increasing. FES will manage boar, on the NFE, working with SNH and neighbours to increase our understanding of boar impacts, population dynamics, future management focus and delivery of any Scottish Government policy or guidance on this evolving issue. Our aim will be to reduce potential damage and impacts to forest, environmental, agricultural and social interests.

      "stalking As part of our forest protection activities we  provide suitably qualified members of the public with opportunity to participate in stalking on land managed by FES.  In protecting the forest environment from adverse deer impacts we are currently able to provide that opportunity for around 370 recreational stalkers each year on approximately 80,000 hectares (12% of the NFE), representing around 5,550 stalking trips    per year.  Stalking on the NFE contributes to the local economy. For example a BASC deer stalking lease on Arran is estimated to directly contribute around £45,000/annum to local businesses. Stalking also generates income for FES, which helps offset our deer management costs. We continually review the balance between  recreational stalking and in-house deer management, seeking to identify additional areas for recreational stalking as and where appropriate. In each case we assess the deer management priorities, damage impact risks and challenges we face. In high risk situations we are less likely to offer recreational stalking. We also assess the suitability of the area for recreational stalking in terms of both geographical location and local issues like collaboration with neighbours and interaction with other uses  of the area, for example the public. We are currently phasing out deer management  leases and introducing deer management permissions, which are a more flexible basis  for offering recreational stalking in a fair and open way, and with lower costs of administration. Permissions are offered on a one year plus one year basis up to a maximum of five years.  We require recreational stalkers to have DCS 2 (or have DSC 1 and attain DSC 2 within year one). They must hold a valid British firearms certificate, including authorisation to hold or purchase a legal calibre of firearm for shooting deer and must hold sufficient public liability insurance.

      "Recreational stalkers enter into an agreement  with FES to cull an agreed number of deer in order to help manage deer impacts on the NFE. They are required to work to agreed procedures and health and safety management. Deer shot by recreational stalkers are usually retained by the stalker. Where carcasses are to be sold-on, FES will encourage the use of SQWV approved venison dealers. FES retains concurrent rights to manage the cull where it is falling behind or where deer impacts and deer numbers appear to be rising. This is in order to protect the natural heritage and our wider land management objectives.  In recognition of the benefits of contributing   to local economic activity we will, in 2014/15, assess the NFE’s potential for stag shooting permissions in the Red deer range.  Accompanied stalking FES provides members of the public some opportunities to stalk deer, accompanied  by an FES Wildlife Ranger. Clients must have a firearms certificate and appropriate insurance. Our accompanied stalking offer attracts   clients from Europe and the UK to shoot deer  in-season. In 2013/14 FCS offered 12 stag  weeks and 4 Doe/hind weeks. This has  spin-off benefits for local businesses such  as accommodation and catering. During 2014/15 we will review accompanied  stalking, and look at opportunities to develop  the associated wildlife viewing photography  and field-craft aspects of the experience. However, availability will always be somewhat limited given our land management and  natural heritage protection priorities.

      "we do provide the Scottish venison industry with a regular supply  of quality deer carcasses to support the marketing of healthy venison products to the consumer. All carcasses shot by our Wildlife Rangers and contractors on the NFE are supplied under Chain of Custody and are FSC 100 per cent approved. We meet our Chain of Custody responsibilities as part of our UK Woodland Assurance Scheme commitments. By doing so we contribute to the sustainable economic development objectives of ‘Scotland’s Wild Deer: A National Approach’.  As Scotland’s single largest producer of wild  venison we supplied, in 2013/14, in the region of 26,000 quality deer carcasses directly to the venison industry. This was mainly via a long-term contract and partnership arrangement with a major game dealer, but also via local sales.  We collaborate with the contracted game dealer to promote Scottish wild venison, through branded packaging - around 1.2 million items per year. We will work with the game dealer to promote the direct link between sustainably managed forests, the sustainable culling of deer to protect the forest environment and the supply of quality assured venison to the consumer.  We will work with them to promote the marketing of all four species of deer,  including Roe which forms 49% of our cull. Each year we provide several hundred deer carcasses for local sale to individual members of the public, small local businesses and niche markets. FES has the appropriate Venison Dealers Licence granted by Local Authorities. In recognition of the benefits to the venison  supply chain, we will make every effort to cull more stags earlier in the season ( July, Aug), within the operational constraints which apply at that time of year.  In recognition of the venison industry’s need   for a supply of venison throughout the year, in 2014-15 we will continue to explore the potential for the development of a deer park on the NFE.

Where appropriate we will work with SVP and SQWV to promote industry best practice nationally.  We have an ongoing programme of investing in  equipment, larders, vehicles, systems, training and development in accordance with the requirements of the SQWV assurance scheme standards, which is endorsed by the Food Standards Agency. This helps ensure that well-presented, quality carcasses are made available to customers at FES deer larders in accordance with food hygiene standards such as the Food Hygiene Regulations 2006.  We will continue to invest appropriately   in the best practice and quality assurance  aspects of our deer management and venison supply work (eg high standards of culling, gralloching, extraction, lardering, presentation and traceability), and we will encourage permission holders to apply SQWV standards and to sell venison to SQWV accredited game dealers. Quality Assurance of the standards  and assessment of competence is inherent  in the FES support to the DMQ Quality Assurance Group.  Deer Larders We maintain a modern fit-for–purpose infrastructure of 37 deer larders and associated carcass management systems.

      "is avoided and the sustainability of the natural heritage and the landowner’s management objectives are not compromised. A habitat’s carrying capacity is at its lowest during the winter months and this forms the limiting factor for a deer population. Landscape/Ecosystem Approach:   FES manages living ecosystems (ie forests, riparian zones, moorland and bogs), to deliver a range of public benefits. As a result of our sustainable management of wild deer populations we: •  produce quality wild venison   (a by-product of the culling operation); •  help in the production of quality timber  (by reducing deer damage impacts to growing trees); and •  maintain and support a diverse range of habitats and animals (by reducing browsing pressure on ground vegetation and shrub layers). An example of this is our partnership with RSPB and Woodland Trust Scotland to manage the Loch Katrine catchment ecosystem and deer populations at a landscape scale. Ecosystem Services:   there are four categories: •  provisioning services which include the supply  of timber, farmed and wild food (like venison), clean water, minerals and renewable energy; •  regulating services which include sequestration of carbon in growing trees, flood mitigation, cleaning city air and encouraging pollinating insects; •  cultural services where people enjoy and appreciate the NFE as a place to exercise, learn, relax and get inspired about nature and history; and •  supporting services which is how the NFE helps the basic natural cycles of water, nutrients and life. Integrated Land Management: is getting the best mix of sustainable land uses and management regimes, working within natural limits, will help us deliver more from the  NFE in the long term.

      "The National Forest Estate manages deer populations to protect the environment, biodiversity, and natural heritage. The Forestry Commission Scotland's Forest Enterprise Scotland agency works with stakeholders to manage deer and their impacts through an integrated approach. The goal is to maintain healthy wild deer populations, manage deer impacts across the NFE, and contribute to Scotland's Wild Deer: a National Approach. The Scottish deer population consists of two native species (Red and Roe) and two introduced species (Sika and Fallow), with an estimated total population of around 777,000. The organization aims to protect and enhance the environment by managing deer populations, ensuring long-term sustainability of Scotland's natural resources. Deer management practices balance environmental, social, and economic benefits, prioritizing conservation of Scotland's natural heritage while balancing competing demands for land use.\n",
      "The Forestry Commission's deer management strategy involves collaboration with stakeholders to achieve sustainable deer management across Scotland. The commission contributes financially to organizations like the Association of Deer Management Groups and local Deer Management Groups, and has representatives on their executive committees. Effective deer management is essential for delivering ecosystem services that support natural cycles, including timber production, tourism, and conservation. The commission supports various deer initiatives, such as the Scottish Lowlands Deer Network, and aims to demonstrate delivery of environmental protection, economic development, social well-being, and wild deer welfare through research, development, and training.\n",
      "FES raises awareness about Scottish deer's importance, deer management activities, and high standards for environmental protection and welfare. We prioritize safety with professional advisors, technology, and continuous improvement to mitigate risk. Our deer management ensures public safety and Lyme's disease prevention through tick avoidance education.\n",
      "We use evidence-based methods to determine deer densities and culling targets, including data from habitat assessments, stocking density counts, tree damage evaluations, dung counts, and helicopter/ground-based surveys. Our goal is to predict damage impact levels, monitor immigration, set culls to prevent or reduce impacts, and ensure clarity of objectives. Fencing can be challenging, but internal fences are minimized, with perimeter fencing used more often for successful tree establishment.\n",
      "Here is the summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "Between 2010/11 and 2014/15, Forestry Commission Scotland (FES) culled a total of 27,542 deer on its National Forest Estate. The culling was done to contribute to the Scottish Cull, with consideration given to future use. Out-of-season and night shooting are essential for managing damage impacts from deer. Female Red Deer were not culled between April and September, except in exceptional circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deer health and welfare are prioritized through monitoring and research into diseases such as Chronic Wasting Disease and TB. Risk management and contingency planning are implemented to minimize the risk of deer disease outbreaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FES also offers recreational deer stalking opportunities on its National Forest Estate, generating income for FES and helping offset deer management costs. The organization supplies quality deer carcasses to the Scottish venison industry, contributing to sustainable economic development objectives.\n",
      "Maintaining balance between deer populations and habitats ensures long-term sustainability of Scotland's natural heritage.\n"
